Featured Projects

[TIP3P Water Simulation](https://github.com/Ryan-Cooley/TIP3P-Water-Simulation): Molecular‑dynamics simulation of water boxes using OpenMM, with trajectory analysis in VMD to study water interactions.

[Quant Option Pricer](https://github.com/Ryan-Cooley/quant-option-pricer)
Python project simulating European call option pricing via Monte Carlo methods: geometric Brownian motion, yfinance data extraction, risk metrics analysis, and visualization.

[SMA Crossover Backtester](https://github.com/Ryan-Cooley/sma_backtester): Production-ready Python framework for designing, testing, and optimizing SMA crossover strategies with interactive dashboards and automated parameter sweeps.

[VBA Data Processing Automation](https://github.com/Ryan-Cooley/VBA_Automation): Suite of VBA macros that automated Excel‑based data processing and reporting, cutting end‑to‑end task time by over 1200% during my Entegris internship.
